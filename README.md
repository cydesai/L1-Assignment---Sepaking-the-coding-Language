Welcome to the Python Programs Repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to perform various tasks, including calculating the median score from a list, checking for leap years, finding missing numbers from a list, and checking for palindromes.

Programs:

1. Median Score Calculator:  This program calculates the median of a list of numbers. It handles both even and odd length lists, returning the middle value or the average of the two middle values.

2. Leap Year Checker:  The Leap Year Checker determines whether a given year is a leap year. The program follows the standard rules for leap years: a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100, unless they are also divisible by 400.

3. Missing Number Finder:  This script finds the missing number in a sequence. It assumes that the sequence contains integers from 1 to n with one number missing and returns that missing number.

4. Palindrome Checker:  The Palindrome Checker checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Each program can be run individually. For example, to use the Leap Year Checker: python leap_year_checker.py
Follow similar steps to run the other programs. You can modify the input directly in the script or update the code to accept input from the user.
